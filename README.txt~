I write this project on my Ubuntu 15.04 OS.

I used python 2.7.0 and library "pygame", "random" and "sys". No other tools or external library has been used on this project.

Game manual is displayed to the user inside the game, clicking on "Rules" button.

Technical document is structured inside every sheets of python i created. I tryed to comment a lot my statements, i hope it is understandable and readable.
